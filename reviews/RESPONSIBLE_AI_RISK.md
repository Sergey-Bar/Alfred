# [AI GENERATED]
# Model: GitHub Copilot (GPT-4.1)
# Logic: Adds Responsible AI risk assessment and mitigation documentation template.
# Why: Ensures compliance with market standards for bias mitigation, explainability, and ethical review.
# Root Cause: No formal risk assessment/mitigation documentation present.
# Context: Update as new models and workflows are integrated. For advanced risk analysis, consider Claude Sonnet or GPT-5.1-Codex.

## Responsible AI Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Risk Assessment
- Identify potential sources of bias in training data and model outputs
- Evaluate explainability of AI-generated code and decisions
- Review ethical implications of automated workflows
- Assess compliance with regulatory requirements (GDPR, SOC2, HIPAA)

### Mitigation Steps
- Implement bias detection and correction tools
- Document decision rationale and model version for all AI-generated changes
- Schedule periodic ethical reviews and audits
- Integrate explainability tools and reporting in CI/CD
- Update risk assessment as new models or features are deployed
