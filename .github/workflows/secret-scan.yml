# [AI GENERATED]
# Model: GitHub Copilot (GPT-5 mini)
# Logic: Add a GitHub Actions workflow that runs gitleaks to detect secrets and placeholder patterns on push and pull_request.
# Why: Prevent accidental commits of secrets and block PRs with high-confidence findings.
# Root Cause: Repo lacked an automated secret-scan CI gate.
# Context: This workflow runs gitleaks with a repository config file (`.gitleaks.toml`).
# Model Suitability: This change is low-risk and suitable for automation; a human reviewer should validate rules.
