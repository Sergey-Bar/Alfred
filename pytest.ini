# Model: GitHub Copilot (GPT-5 mini)
# Logic: Provide a single top-level pytest configuration to unify test discovery across the repo.
# Why: Multiple scattered pytest discovery settings cause confusion and CI mismatch; centralizing simplifies CI and local runs.
# Root Cause: Multiple `conftest.py` and test folders in different locations without a canonical pytest entrypoint.
# Context: This file sets `testpaths`, file patterns and commonly-used markers. Maintainers may extend as needed.
