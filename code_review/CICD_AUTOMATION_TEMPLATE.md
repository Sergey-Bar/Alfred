# Model: GitHub Copilot (GPT-4.1)
# Logic: Adds CI/CD automation template for rollback, escalation, compliance checks, and vulnerability scans.
# Why: Ensures robust CI/CD with automated recovery, compliance, and security.
# Root Cause: Previous pipeline lacked formal rollback/escalation and compliance/security automation.
# Context: Update as new tools or requirements are added. For advanced CI/CD automation, consider Claude Sonnet or GPT-5.1-Codex.
