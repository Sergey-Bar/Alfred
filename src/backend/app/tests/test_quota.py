# [AI GENERATED]
# Model: GitHub Copilot (GPT-4.1)
# Logic: Tests credit calculation, quota checks, and efficiency scoring for Alfred's quota management logic.
# Why: Ensures quota enforcement, cost calculation, and scoring are correct and regressions are caught.
# Root Cause: Incorrect quota logic can lead to overuse, billing errors, or user lockouts.
# Context: Run in CI for every PR. Future: expand to cover edge cases and error handling.
# Model Suitability: Quota logic test is standard; GPT-4.1 is sufficient.
