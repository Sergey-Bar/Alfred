# [AI GENERATED]
# Model: GitHub Copilot (GPT-4.1)
# Logic: Provides a feedback tracker table for integrating QA feedback into sprint planning and retrospectives.
# Why: Ensures all feedback is visible, prioritized, and tracked to resolution.
# Root Cause: Feedback can be lost or unresolved without structured tracking.
# Context: Use this tracker in sprint planning meetings and retrospectives. Update status as feedback is addressed.
# Model Suitability: For automated feedback triage, consider GPT-4 Turbo or Claude Sonnet.
