# [AI GENERATED]
# Model: GitHub Copilot (GPT-4.1)
# Logic: Adds examples of AI-generated code comments for documentation and code review.
# Why: Provides clear reference for required comment headers in AI-generated code.
# Root Cause: No examples present in documentation for new contributors.
# Context: Update as new models or comment formats are adopted. For advanced comment generation, consider Claude Sonnet or GPT-5.1-Codex.

## Example AI-Generated Code Comments

```python
# [AI GENERATED]
# Model: GitHub Copilot (GPT-4.1)
# Logic: Implements quota enforcement for API requests.
# Why: Prevents overuse of LLM credits and ensures fair allocation.
# Root Cause: Previous implementation lacked quota checks.
# Context: Extend for vacation sharing and priority overrides. For advanced quota logic, consider Claude Sonnet.
```

```js
// [AI GENERATED]
// Model: GitHub Copilot (GPT-4.1)
// Logic: Adds error handling for API failures.
// Why: Improves user experience and reliability.
// Root Cause: Missing try/catch in fetch call.
// Context: Called from VS Code extension status bar. For robust error handling, consider GPT-4 Turbo.
