# Model: GitHub Copilot (GPT-4.1)
# Logic: Adds a quarterly review schedule for documentation, tests, and DevOps as recommended in project review.
# Why: Ensures continuous improvement and up-to-date practices for quality and compliance.
# Root Cause: Lack of formal review schedule can lead to outdated docs, tests, and automation.
# Context: This schedule should be reviewed and updated annually. Assign responsible parties and track completion in project management tools.
# Model Suitability: GPT-4.1 is sufficient for generating review schedules and documentation.
