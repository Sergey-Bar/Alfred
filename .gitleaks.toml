# [AI GENERATED]
# Model: GitHub Copilot (GPT-5 mini)
# Logic: Provide gitleaks configuration with a focused rule to catch placeholder credentials and common test passwords.
# Why: Detect placeholder secrets like "changeme" or "test_password" which appear in CI and tests.
# Root Cause: Repo contains example placeholders and test credentials that should be gated by CI.
# Context: This config is intentionally conservative; maintainers should tune rules to avoid false positives.
